# Staff

For technical questions related to the codebase, please check piazza first (or post a query there). For discussing the course material or the individual projects, please feel free to attend whichever TA's office hours are convenient. For project-related questions, please coordinate a time to chat directly with your assigned project mentor.

## Office Hours 
All TA office hours will be held virtually. We will explore the options of holding in-person office hours too, subject to interest from students/TAs and availability of a room. Instructor office hours may be held in-person or remotely.  

TA Office Hours are hosted on Microsoft Teams, using the [Khoury Office Hours app](https://officehours.khoury.northeastern.edu/). Please see the user guide for information on how to log in and ask questions. Please note that VPN is now required to access office hours app when off campus. 

**We usually do not hold office hours during school holidays (Spring Break, MLK Day, President's Day, Indigenous Peoples' Day, Veteran's Day and Thanksgiving Break)**
